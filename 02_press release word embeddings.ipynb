       "      <td>GUELPH - Canadian Solar Inc. ('Canadian Solar' or 'the Company') (NASDAQ: CSIQ) today announced its wholly-owned subsidiary, Recurrent Energy, LLC ('Recurrent Energy'), completed the sale of the Maplewood 1 and Maplewood 2 solar projects to a leading U.S. annuity and life insurance company.  Both projects are located in Pecos County, Texas, near the towns of Fort Stockton and McCamey, and have a combined capacity of 328 MWp or 250 MWac. Maplewood 1 and Maplewood 2 are both currently under construction and are expected to reach commercial operation before the end of Q3 2021.  Construction of the Maplewood 1 and Maplewood 2 solar projects commenced in the summer of 2020 after Recurrent Energy closed $ 282 million of debt financing provided by a bank club led by Norddeutsche Landesbank and included Export Development Canada, Rabobank, National Bank of Canada and Bayerische Landesbank. The Maplewood projects' offtakers are Anheuser-Busch, the world's largest brewer, and Energy Transfer Partners, the Dallas-based Fortune 100 oil and gas pipeline company. Anheuser-Busch will purchase the 222 MWac from the Maplewood 1 project under a 15-year power purchase agreement ('PPA'), helping the brewer achieve its 100% renewable electricity four years in advance of its 2025 target. Maplewood 2 will deliver 28 MWac of clean power to Energy Transfer Partners under a 15-year PPA.  Both projects utilize Canadian Solar's high-efficiency bifacial modules. The electricity generated by the Maplewood projects is expected to displace approximately 518,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions annually, equivalent to taking 112,655 cars off the road.  'This transaction is Recurrent's first major project sale with commercial and industrial (CI) offtakers,' said Shawn Qu, Chairman and CEO of Canadian Solar. 'We already see that an increasing number of corporations and public sector organizations across the globe are directly contracting with renewable energy projects to serve their load. In particular, corporates are finding that solar energy can not only reduce their electricity costs but can also help them meaningfully reduce the carbon footprint of their operations. This is a particularly exciting milestone given the ongoing challenges posed by the global pandemic and is a testament that solar energy has truly entered into the mainstream.'

       "      <td>ENP Newswire - 24 June 2011   Release date- 23062011 - CHICAGO - As part of its commitment to accurately report its emissions and further reduce its carbon footprint, Exelon Corporation has joined The Climate Registry, the leading voluntary greenhouse gas registry in North America.   'Exelon is demonstrating true environmental leadership by committing to continue reporting its carbon emissions in a public, transparent and credible way,' said Denise Sheehan, executive director of The Climate Registry. 'Measuring your emissions is a critical step to managing them and fostering new ways to reduce your carbon footprint - and your impact on the planet.'   The Climate Registry is an independent nonprofit organization that sets consistent standards for the measurement, verification and reporting of companies' GHG emissions. It is governed by 41 U.S. states and Washington, D.C., Canadian provinces, Mexican states and Native Sovereign Nations.   Exelon is joining The Climate Registry in support of Exelon 2020, the company's business and environmental strategy to reduce 15.7 million tonnes of GHG emissions - the equivalent of Exelon's 2001 carbon footprint - annually by 2020. Exelon, the least carbon-intensive large U.S. electric utility, is already more than halfway to its goal. The strategy includes retiring older, uneconomic coal plants; providing energy-efficiency programs to customers and expanding capacity at Exelon's existing nuclear plants through uprates.   'In the transition to a clean energy future, companies must ensure transparency in how we calculate and report our emissions and must do so in accordance with the most rigorous standards,' said John W. Rowe, chairman and CEO of Exelon. 'In keeping with our Exelon 2020 strategy, Exelon will continue our work to reduce, offset and displace emissions and advocate for an affordable approach to ensuring clean, reliable and secure power for all Americans.'   As a basic member, Exelon will submit its 2010 GHG emissions inventory to The Climate Registry in 2011. Starting in 2012, Exelon's 2011 inventory will undergo annual third-party verification under The Climate Registry's General Reporting Protocol.   Exelon previously participated in EPA's Climate Leaders GHG reporting program, which EPA is phasing down. Under that program, Exelon reduced its annual GHG emissions by 38 percent from its 2001 baseline as of 2008.   About Exelon   Exelon Corporation is one of the nation's largest electric utilities with more than $ 18 billion in annual revenues. The company has one of the industry's largest portfolios of electricity generation capacity, with a nationwide reach and strong positions in the Midwest and Mid-Atlantic. Exelon distributes electricity to approximately 5.4 million customers in northern Illinois and southeastern Pennsylvania and natural gas to approximately 490,000 customers in the Philadelphia area. Exelon is headquartered in Chicago and trades on the NYSE under the ticker EXC.   About The Climate Registry   The Climate Registry is a non-profit organization that operates the only voluntary carbon footprint registry in North America supported by states, provinces, territories and tribes. The Climate Registry helps hundreds of public and private organizations measure, report and reduce their GHG emissions with integrity.   For more information please visit www.climateregistry.org.

       "      <td>For a second consecutive year, Marathon Petroleum Corporation (MPC) has earned the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) ENERGY STAR Partner of the Year - Sustained Excellence Award, the highest honor among ENERGY STAR awards.  MPC is the only company with fuels manufacturing as its primary business to earn the award, which recognizes the company for sustained, top-tier energy efficiency and excellent environmental compliance. Award recipients are part of a distinguished group that have made a long-term commitment to energy efficiency and are among the nation's leaders in driving value for the environment, the economy, and the American people.  The EPA includes the award's Sustained Excellence designation for partners like MPC that have already received ENERGY STAR Partner of the Year recognition for a minimum of two consecutive years and then continue to go above and beyond the criteria needed to qualify for the award.  One contributing factor to MPC's recognition is its industry-leading performance in ENERGY STAR certifications. Certification recognizes a facility for meeting the EPA's strict energy efficiency performance levels, demonstrating excellent environmental compliance, and achieving energy efficiency that places it in the top 25% of similar facilities nationwide.  MPC was also the first independent U.S. refiner to establish a companywide GHG emissions intensity reduction target (30% reduction from 2014's level by 2030), and link annual progress to employee and executive compensation programs. Partnering with ENERGY STAR helps MPC identify new strategies for improving energy efficiency, a critical step for meeting this goal.  Partner of the Year award winners are selected from a network of thousands of ENERGY STAR partners.

       "      <td>The Nuclear Energy Institute issued the following news release: Three years ago there were about a dozen nuclear-related bills in state houses; this year there are about 100. That's because more and more the 30 states hosting our 99 nuclear plants are waking up to the fact that without them, their economic and environmental well-being are in jeopardy. Even in states without plants, nuclear technology is at the center of debates on clean energy, grid security and resiliency. Two years ago New York and Illinois pioneered zero emissions credit (ZEC) programs that compensated nuclear plants in those states for their carbon-free attributes. Last October Connecticut joined those states with its Zero Carbon Procurement measure, which allows the Millstone nuclear plant to bid into markets with other zero-carbon energy sources like hydropower, wind and solar. As the architect of the New York and Illinois ZEC programs, Joe Dominguez, Exelon Corp.'s executive vice president of governmental and regulatory affairs and public policy, received the William S. Lee Award for Industry Leadership this week. \"Achieving the ZEC programs in New York and Illinois took Joe and his team years of daunting work,\" NEI Chairman Donald Brandt said at the award ceremony during NEI's annual conference, the Nuclear Energy Assembly. \"Joe's leadership and achievements on this effort have benefited the entire nuclear industry.\" On the same day, New Jersey became the latest state to preserve its largest source of resilient and reliable carbon-free energy when Gov. Phil Murphy signed that state's zero emission credit bill into law. \"The Salem and Hope Creek nuclear plants play pivotal roles in New Jersey's economy and environment, and Gov. Murphy is to be commended for signing this bill into law to help preserve these critical energy assets,\" NEI President and Chief Executive Officer Maria Korsnick said. Tweet This The 30 states hosting our 99 nuclear plants are waking up to the fact that without nuclear, their economic and environmental well-being are in jeopardy. Ohio and Pennsylvania have considered similar measures, with stakeholders from across the political spectrum putting pressure on lawmakers to act quickly in response to plant closure announcements. \"Policymakers in Ohio and Pennsylvania have limited time to act to preserve nuclear plants in their states,\" Korsnick added. At this year's Nuclear Energy Assembly, state representatives discussed how state- or region-specific legislative and regulatory approaches must reflect local concerns in order to advance the pro-nuclear conversation. Dominion Energy's two nuclear reactors at the Millstone Power Station provide Connecticut with almost half of its electricity--and 98 percent of its emission-free power. Last October, Gov. Dannel Malloy signed the Zero Carbon Procurement bill into law. Connecticut State Rep. Lonnie Reed (D) explained how the bill passed after two years of debate. \"We had to humanize the nuclear discussion. The climate change message resonates in Connecticut. People see how the level of Long Island Sound has been rising and have experienced increased tidal flooding of the roads and railways that run along our shoreline,\" Reed said. Stan Wise, former chairman of the Georgia Public Service Commission (PSC), said the PSC has long been a supporter of Georgia's nuclear fleet, including the Vogtle 3 and 4 AP1000 new build project. Georgia's four nuclear plants provide about a quarter of the state's electricity and approximately two-thirds of its emission-free electricity. \"We appreciate nuclear energy for its attributes of stable and affordable rates and reliable, dependable generation. Public confidence in the PSC and in our utilities has gone a long way toward maintaining our pro-nuclear position. The governor also has been supportive in keeping all the Vogtle construction partners together,\" Wise said. \"I am confident that we'll turn the switch on Vogtle 3 and 4 in 2022.\" Maryland's two Calvert Cliffs nuclear reactors provide the state with nearly 40 percent of its electricity and almost 90 percent of its emission-free power. Maryland PSC commissioner Tony O'Donnell said the state legislature has recently formed a nuclear energy caucus and is considering carbon policy. \"The message is you cannot meet our aggressive greenhouse gas reduction goals, our renewable portfolio standards, our clean air and water policies, without nuclear,\" he said.

       "      <td>Chicago: Exelon Corporation (EXCU) has issued the following press release: Exelon Generation announced today that Three Mile Island Generating Station Unit 1 (TMI) will shut down by Sept. 30, 2019, as previously announced in May 2017. With only three legislative session days remaining in May and no action taken to advance House Bill 11 or Senate Bill 510, it is clear a state policy solution will not be enacted before June 1, in time to reverse the premature retirement of the plant. âToday is a difficult day for our employees, who were hopeful that state policymakers would support valuing carbon-free nuclear energy the same way they value other forms of clean energy in time to save TMI from a premature closure,â said Bryan Hanson, Exelon senior vice president and chief nuclear officer.   âI want to thank the hundreds of men and women who will continue to safely operate TMI through September. We will offer a position elsewhere in Exelon to every employee who wishes to stay with the company and is willing to relocate, and we will do all we can to support the community, the employees and their families during this difficult period,â Hanson added. Exelon Generation previously announced that the station would prematurely shut down, absent policy reform, due to economic challenges and market flaws that fail to recognize the environmental and resiliency benefits from TMI and other zero-carbon nuclear energy plants across the Commonwealth. âAlthough we see strong support in Harrisburg and throughout Pennsylvania to reduce carbon emissions and maintain the environmental and economic benefits provided by nuclear energy, we donât see a path forward for policy changes before the June 1 fuel purchasing deadline for TMI,â said Kathleen BarrÃ³n, Exelon senior vice president, government and regulatory affairs and public policy. âWhile TMI will close in September as planned, the state has eight other zero-carbon nuclear units that provide around-the-clock clean energy, avoiding millions of tons of carbon emissions every year. We will continue to work with the legislature and all stakeholders to enact policies that will secure a clean energy future for all Pennsylvanians.â Exelon Generationâs highly trained employees will continue to operate the plant at world-class levels of excellence through September, with staff transitions expected within six months of the plantâs final shut down. Over the past two years, Exelon Generation has worked actively with TMI employees to map them to other positions, and many have already accepted placement elsewhere within the company. Exelon Generation will continue to work with employees to support them during this transition. Last month, Exelon Generation filed the federally required Post Shutdown Decommissioning Activities Report detailing plans for TMI after its final shutdown, including transitioning staff in three phases down to 50 full-time employees by 2022. In the filing, Exelon Generation selected âSAFSTOR,â one of three decommissioning options for the plant, and outlined a plan to dismantle large components, including the stationâs cooling towers, beginning in 2074.

       "      <td>In its ongoing effort to address climate change, Exelon announced today that as of the end of 2008 it had reduced its greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by more than 35 percent from 2001 levels. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) recently verified Exelon's reduction of nearly 6 million metric tons in carbon emissions - an amount equal to the annual emissions of approximately 1 million passenger vehicles. Stantec, an independent third-party provider of environmental consulting services, also verified the reduction.  Exelon's GHG emissions reduction not only exceeded its voluntary EPA Climate Leaders program goal of 8 percent, but also shows significant progress on the company's carbon reduction strategy, Exelon 2020: A Low-Carbon Roadmap. Exelon 2020 sets a goal of reducing, offsetting or displacing more than 15 million metric tons of GHG emissions per year by 2020. This is more than the company's carbon footprint in 2001, its first full year of operation. Exelon 2020 is the natural evolution of the company's early climate change initiatives and expands the reach of its emissions reduction programs beyond the Exelon family of companies to its customers, communities, suppliers and the markets it serves. Exelon Chairman and CEO John W. Rowe announced Exelon's carbon reduction achievement today in a speech at the Energy Information Administration 2009 Energy Conference in Washington, D.C. \"As a national energy policy begins to take shape in Washington, we believe that our industry must take decisive action to address climate change,\" Rowe said. \"For Exelon, reducing our greenhouse gas emissions is both an environmental and a business necessity. We committed to a voluntary reduction goal under the EPA Climate Leaders program to demonstrate that we could achieve meaningful carbon reductions. We expanded that goal with Exelon 2020, which will drive our transition to a low-carbon future.\" \"Exelon's leadership on reducing its greenhouse gas emissions shows us all what can be accomplished through sustained commitment and action,\" said Kathleen Hogan, Director, Climate Protection Partnerships Division at the U.S. EPA. Consistent with its cost-efficient approach, Exelon initially focused on its operations to achieve most of its early GHG reductions, including: Retiring less efficient and higher-emitting fossil fuel power plants in Massachusetts, Pennsylvania and Texas Reducing leakage of GHGs, including sulfur hexafluoride, from its electricity transmission and distribution systems and natural gas delivery systems Increasing energy efficiency in its buildings Increasing the fuel efficiency of its vehicle fleet. \"Our progress to date highlights the important role of competitive markets in enabling the transition to a low-carbon economy,\" said Rowe. \"We believe that competitive energy markets are critical in driving economical decisions, such as retiring inefficient fossil plants and pursuing the most cost-effective emissions reductions first. Competition also impels us to advocate for federal cap-and-trade legislation, which we believe will address climate change at the lowest possible cost to customers.\" Exelon continues to implement numerous initiatives this year working toward its Exelon 2020 goal. These include: further increasing the energy efficiency of its buildings, power plants, vehicle fleets; continuing to engage its suppliers to create an industry-leading green supply chain; procuring renewable energy to offset a portion of Exelon's energy consumption; and expanding customer energy-efficiency programs offered by Exelon's energy delivery subsidiaries, ComEd and PECO, including Smart Grid pilot programs. Exelon also plans to continue to increase the output of its nuclear power plants through uprates to offer more low-carbon electricity in the marketplace. Exelon Corporation is one of the nation's largest electric utilities with approximately $19 billion in annual revenues. The company has one of the industry's largest portfolios of electricity generation capacity, with a nationwide reach and strong positions in the Midwest and Mid-Atlantic.

       "3      GUELPH - Canadian Solar Inc. ('Canadian Solar' or 'the Company') (NASDAQ: CSIQ) today announced its wholly-owned subsidiary, Recurrent Energy, LLC ('Recurrent Energy'), completed the sale of the Maplewood 1 and Maplewood 2 solar projects to a leading U.S. annuity and life insurance company.  Both projects are located in Pecos County, Texas, near the towns of Fort Stockton and McCamey, and have a combined capacity of 328 MWp or 250 MWac. Maplewood 1 and Maplewood 2 are both currently under construction and are expected to reach commercial operation before the end of Q3 2021.  Construction of the Maplewood 1 and Maplewood 2 solar projects commenced in the summer of 2020 after Recurrent Energy closed $ 282 million of debt financing provided by a bank club led by Norddeutsche Landesbank and included Export Development Canada, Rabobank, National Bank of Canada and Bayerische Landesbank. The Maplewood projects' offtakers are Anheuser-Busch, the world's largest brewer, and Energy Transfer Partners, the Dallas-based Fortune 100 oil and gas pipeline company. Anheuser-Busch will purchase the 222 MWac from the Maplewood 1 project under a 15-year power purchase agreement ('PPA'), helping the brewer achieve its 100% renewable electricity four years in advance of its 2025 target. Maplewood 2 will deliver 28 MWac of clean power to Energy Transfer Partners under a 15-year PPA.  Both projects utilize Canadian Solar's high-efficiency bifacial modules. The electricity generated by the Maplewood projects is expected to displace approximately 518,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions annually, equivalent to taking 112,655 cars off the road.  'This transaction is Recurrent's first major project sale with commercial and industrial (CI) offtakers,' said Shawn Qu, Chairman and CEO of Canadian Solar. 'We already see that an increasing number of corporations and public sector organizations across the globe are directly contracting with renewable energy projects to serve their load. In particular, corporates are finding that solar energy can not only reduce their electricity costs but can also help them meaningfully reduce the carbon footprint of their operations. This is a particularly exciting milestone given the ongoing challenges posed by the global pandemic and is a testament that solar energy has truly entered into the mainstream.'

       "32     ENP Newswire - 24 June 2011   Release date- 23062011 - CHICAGO - As part of its commitment to accurately report its emissions and further reduce its carbon footprint, Exelon Corporation has joined The Climate Registry, the leading voluntary greenhouse gas registry in North America.   'Exelon is demonstrating true environmental leadership by committing to continue reporting its carbon emissions in a public, transparent and credible way,' said Denise Sheehan, executive director of The Climate Registry. 'Measuring your emissions is a critical step to managing them and fostering new ways to reduce your carbon footprint - and your impact on the planet.'   The Climate Registry is an independent nonprofit organization that sets consistent standards for the measurement, verification and reporting of companies' GHG emissions. It is governed by 41 U.S. states and Washington, D.C., Canadian provinces, Mexican states and Native Sovereign Nations.   Exelon is joining The Climate Registry in support of Exelon 2020, the company's business and environmental strategy to reduce 15.7 million tonnes of GHG emissions - the equivalent of Exelon's 2001 carbon footprint - annually by 2020. Exelon, the least carbon-intensive large U.S. electric utility, is already more than halfway to its goal. The strategy includes retiring older, uneconomic coal plants; providing energy-efficiency programs to customers and expanding capacity at Exelon's existing nuclear plants through uprates.   'In the transition to a clean energy future, companies must ensure transparency in how we calculate and report our emissions and must do so in accordance with the most rigorous standards,' said John W. Rowe, chairman and CEO of Exelon. 'In keeping with our Exelon 2020 strategy, Exelon will continue our work to reduce, offset and displace emissions and advocate for an affordable approach to ensuring clean, reliable and secure power for all Americans.'   As a basic member, Exelon will submit its 2010 GHG emissions inventory to The Climate Registry in 2011. Starting in 2012, Exelon's 2011 inventory will undergo annual third-party verification under The Climate Registry's General Reporting Protocol.   Exelon previously participated in EPA's Climate Leaders GHG reporting program, which EPA is phasing down. Under that program, Exelon reduced its annual GHG emissions by 38 percent from its 2001 baseline as of 2008.   About Exelon   Exelon Corporation is one of the nation's largest electric utilities with more than $ 18 billion in annual revenues.

       "62     For a second consecutive year, Marathon Petroleum Corporation (MPC) has earned the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) ENERGY STAR Partner of the Year - Sustained Excellence Award, the highest honor among ENERGY STAR awards.  MPC is the only company with fuels manufacturing as its primary business to earn the award, which recognizes the company for sustained, top-tier energy efficiency and excellent environmental compliance. Award recipients are part of a distinguished group that have made a long-term commitment to energy efficiency and are among the nation's leaders in driving value for the environment, the economy, and the American people.  The EPA includes the award's Sustained Excellence designation for partners like MPC that have already received ENERGY STAR Partner of the Year recognition for a minimum of two consecutive years and then continue to go above and beyond the criteria needed to qualify for the award.  One contributing factor to MPC's recognition is its industry-leading performance in ENERGY STAR certifications. Certification recognizes a facility for meeting the EPA's strict energy efficiency performance levels, demonstrating excellent environmental compliance, and achieving energy efficiency that places it in the top 25% of similar facilities nationwide.  MPC was also the first independent U.S. refiner to establish a companywide GHG emissions intensity reduction target (30% reduction from 2014's level by 2030), and link annual progress to employee and executive compensation programs.

       "99     IRVING - TXU Energy today announced that it has recognized three South Texas companies as winners in the second annual TXU Energy Leadership Awards Program.  The awards, which were announced in conjunction with the TXU Energy Summit held today in Houston, recognize corporate and non-profit organizations that demonstrate leadership in the areas of energy management, innovation, and community.  'We are committed to working with our customers across Texas to help them accomplish their sustainability goals and maintain their environmental commitments,' said Gabe Castro, TXU Energy vice president of business markets. 'We are thrilled to recognize these three outstanding organizations whose initiatives enhance their standards for energy conservation, improve efficiency, and represent community stewardship. These companies have seen tremendous results in pursuit of their energy and sustainability goals, and we hope their success will influence other organizations to strive for the same.'  The three South Texas-area winners include: Leadership in Innovation - Plains All American Pipeline  Plains All American Pipeline has set new standards for operational excellence, inspiring others in their industry to follow their lead. They installed pump variable frequency drives that helped them recognize a savings of 14,290,000 kWh annually. Not only have they elected to participate in the 4 Coincident Peak (4CP) program by curbing usage during ERCOT's peak demand to reduce strain on the grid, but their active and intentional management of usage during those periods has resulted in a savings of more than 20% in transmission and distribution utility charges, while still maintaining optimal operations.  Leadership in Energy Management - Magnolia ISD  Magnolia Independent School District has demonstrated excellence in managing electricity consumption and spend while minimizing the district's impact on the environment. Magnolia ISD has upgraded to more energy-efficient equipment and integrated computer-controlled cooling and heating systems. This helped the district recognize an estimated savings of 785 kW and 2,203,000 kWh annually. Leveraging power market insights, energy efficiency best practices, and TXU Greenback rebates, Magnolia ISD has reduced expenditures by over 25%, providing savings that can be reinvested in the classroom for their students and faculty.  Leadership in Community - Star of Hope  Star of Hope is a non-profit organization that serves and exists to make a difference in the lives of Houston's homeless men, women, and children. A TXU Energy customer for the last four years, the organization provides a variety of programs supporting education, employment, and life management skills to encourage positive life changes. Star of Hope's various services deliver a comprehensive approach to addressing a large range of issues that are faced by Houston's homeless such as mental and physical illness, and lack of education and resources to be successful. By providing a haven where homeless individuals feel supported, Star of Hope has backed its community for more than 100 years.  TXU Energy is proud to share the accomplishments of the recipients of its awards program and will present additional Energy Leadership Awards this fall at its Dallas/Fort Worth-area summit.

       "822    The Nuclear Energy Institute issued the following news release: Three years ago there were about a dozen nuclear-related bills in state houses; this year there are about 100. That's because more and more the 30 states hosting our 99 nuclear plants are waking up to the fact that without them, their economic and environmental well-being are in jeopardy. Even in states without plants, nuclear technology is at the center of debates on clean energy, grid security and resiliency. Two years ago New York and Illinois pioneered zero emissions credit (ZEC) programs that compensated nuclear plants in those states for their carbon-free attributes. Last October Connecticut joined those states with its Zero Carbon Procurement measure, which allows the Millstone nuclear plant to bid into markets with other zero-carbon energy sources like hydropower, wind and solar. As the architect of the New York and Illinois ZEC programs, Joe Dominguez, Exelon Corp.'s executive vice president of governmental and regulatory affairs and public policy, received the William S. Lee Award for Industry Leadership this week. \"Achieving the ZEC programs in New York and Illinois took Joe and his team years of daunting work,\" NEI Chairman Donald Brandt said at the award ceremony during NEI's annual conference, the Nuclear Energy Assembly. \"Joe's leadership and achievements on this effort have benefited the entire nuclear industry.\" On the same day, New Jersey became the latest state to preserve its largest source of resilient and reliable carbon-free energy when Gov. Phil Murphy signed that state's zero emission credit bill into law. \"The Salem and Hope Creek nuclear plants play pivotal roles in New Jersey's economy and environment, and Gov. Murphy is to be commended for signing this bill into law to help preserve these critical energy assets,\" NEI President and Chief Executive Officer Maria Korsnick said. Tweet This The 30 states hosting our 99 nuclear plants are waking up to the fact that without nuclear, their economic and environmental well-being are in jeopardy. Ohio and Pennsylvania have considered similar measures, with stakeholders from across the political spectrum putting pressure on lawmakers to act quickly in response to plant closure announcements. \"Policymakers in Ohio and Pennsylvania have limited time to act to preserve nuclear plants in their states,\" Korsnick added. At this year's Nuclear Energy Assembly, state representatives discussed how state- or region-specific legislative and regulatory approaches must reflect local concerns in order to advance the pro-nuclear conversation. Dominion Energy's two nuclear reactors at the Millstone Power Station provide Connecticut with almost half of its electricity--and 98 percent of its emission-free power. Last October, Gov. Dannel Malloy signed the Zero Carbon Procurement bill into law. Connecticut State Rep. Lonnie Reed (D) explained how the bill passed after two years of debate. \"We had to humanize the nuclear discussion. The climate change message resonates in Connecticut. People see how the level of Long Island Sound has been rising and have experienced increased tidal flooding of the roads and railways that run along our shoreline,\" Reed said. Stan Wise, former chairman of the Georgia Public Service Commission (PSC), said the PSC has long been a supporter of Georgia's nuclear fleet, including the Vogtle 3 and 4 AP1000 new build project. Georgia's four nuclear plants provide about a quarter of the state's electricity and approximately two-thirds of its emission-free electricity. \"We appreciate nuclear energy for its attributes of stable and affordable rates and reliable, dependable generation. Public confidence in the PSC and in our utilities has gone a long way toward maintaining our pro-nuclear position. The governor also has been supportive in keeping all the Vogtle construction partners together,\" Wise said. \"I am confident that we'll turn the switch on Vogtle 3 and 4 in 2022.\" Maryland's two Calvert Cliffs nuclear reactors provide the state with nearly 40 percent of its electricity and almost 90 percent of its emission-free power. Maryland PSC commissioner Tony O'Donnell said the state legislature has recently formed a nuclear energy caucus and is considering carbon policy. \"The message is you cannot meet our aggressive greenhouse gas reduction goals, our renewable portfolio standards, our clean air and water policies, without nuclear,\" he said.

       "840    Chicago: Exelon Corporation (EXCU) has issued the following press release: Exelon Generation announced today that Three Mile Island Generating Station Unit 1 (TMI) will shut down by Sept. 30, 2019, as previously announced in May 2017. With only three legislative session days remaining in May and no action taken to advance House Bill 11 or Senate Bill 510, it is clear a state policy solution will not be enacted before June 1, in time to reverse the premature retirement of the plant. âToday is a difficult day for our employees, who were hopeful that state policymakers would support valuing carbon-free nuclear energy the same way they value other forms of clean energy in time to save TMI from a premature closure,â said Bryan Hanson, Exelon senior vice president and chief nuclear officer.   âI want to thank the hundreds of men and women who will continue to safely operate TMI through September. We will offer a position elsewhere in Exelon to every employee who wishes to stay with the company and is willing to relocate, and we will do all we can to support the community, the employees and their families during this difficult period,â Hanson added. Exelon Generation previously announced that the station would prematurely shut down, absent policy reform, due to economic challenges and market flaws that fail to recognize the environmental and resiliency benefits from TMI and other zero-carbon nuclear energy plants across the Commonwealth. âAlthough we see strong support in Harrisburg and throughout Pennsylvania to reduce carbon emissions and maintain the environmental and economic benefits provided by nuclear energy, we donât see a path forward for policy changes before the June 1 fuel purchasing deadline for TMI,â said Kathleen BarrÃ³n, Exelon senior vice president, government and regulatory affairs and public policy. âWhile TMI will close in September as planned, the state has eight other zero-carbon nuclear units that provide around-the-clock clean energy, avoiding millions of tons of carbon emissions every year. We will continue to work with the legislature and all stakeholders to enact policies that will secure a clean energy future for all Pennsylvanians.â Exelon Generationâs highly trained employees will continue to operate the plant at world-class levels of excellence through September, with staff transitions expected within six months of the plantâs final shut down. Over the past two years, Exelon Generation has worked actively with TMI employees to map them to other positions, and many have already accepted placement elsewhere within the company. Exelon Generation will continue to work with employees to support them during this transition. Last month, Exelon Generation filed the federally required Post Shutdown Decommissioning Activities Report detailing plans for TMI after its final shutdown, including transitioning staff in three phases down to 50 full-time employees by 2022. In the filing, Exelon Generation selected âSAFSTOR,â one of three decommissioning options for the plant, and outlined a plan to dismantle large components, including the stationâs cooling towers, beginning in 2074.

       "859    The Environmental Protection Agency issued the following news release: The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced today that two manufacturing plants in Louisiana earned ENERGY STAR certifications for their superior energy performance in 2017. Together, Flower Baking Company in Baton Rouge and Marathon Petroleum in Garyville reduced their energy bills by millions and achieved broad emissions reductions, including tons of greenhouse gas emissions. \"Earning ENERGY STAR certification is a real mark of excellence, highlighting companies that are leaders in cutting energy costs and reducing waste,\" said EPA Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation Bill Wehrum. \"This program is in direct line with the administration's priorities to support American manufacturing-- greater efficiency fosters industrial development, greater competitiveness, a strong economy, and a healthy environment.\" The ENERGY STAR industrial program provides industry-specific energy benchmarking tools and other resources for 17 different types of manufacturing plants. These resources allow an industrial plant to compare its energy performance to others in the same industry and therefore establish meaningful energy performance goals. Plants from the automotive, baking, cement, corn refining, food processing, glass manufacturing, pharmaceutical manufacturing, and petroleum refining sectors are among those that qualified in 2017. Since 2006, the ENERGY STAR Industrial Program has annually certified manufacturing plants for reaching the top 25 percent of energy performance in their industries nationwide. Over 190 plants have achieved this distinction since 2006. For more information, see: www.energystar.gov/plants. For specific plant profiles, see: www.energystar.gov/buildinglist. To learn more about how ENERGY STAR and industry work together, see: www.energystar.gov/industry ENERGY STAR(R) is the government-backed symbol for energy efficiency, providing simple, credible, and unbiased information that consumers and businesses rely on to make well-informed decisions. Thousands of industrial, commercial, utility, state, and local organizations--including more than 40 percent of the Fortune 500(R)--rely on their partnership with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to deliver cost-saving energy efficiency solutions.

       "862    In its ongoing effort to address climate change, Exelon announced today that as of the end of 2008 it had reduced its greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by more than 35 percent from 2001 levels. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) recently verified Exelon's reduction of nearly 6 million metric tons in carbon emissions - an amount equal to the annual emissions of approximately 1 million passenger vehicles. Stantec, an independent third-party provider of environmental consulting services, also verified the reduction.  Exelon's GHG emissions reduction not only exceeded its voluntary EPA Climate Leaders program goal of 8 percent, but also shows significant progress on the company's carbon reduction strategy, Exelon 2020: A Low-Carbon Roadmap. Exelon 2020 sets a goal of reducing, offsetting or displacing more than 15 million metric tons of GHG emissions per year by 2020. This is more than the company's carbon footprint in 2001, its first full year of operation. Exelon 2020 is the natural evolution of the company's early climate change initiatives and expands the reach of its emissions reduction programs beyond the Exelon family of companies to its customers, communities, suppliers and the markets it serves. Exelon Chairman and CEO John W. Rowe announced Exelon's carbon reduction achievement today in a speech at the Energy Information Administration 2009 Energy Conference in Washington, D.C. \"As a national energy policy begins to take shape in Washington, we believe that our industry must take decisive action to address climate change,\" Rowe said. \"For Exelon, reducing our greenhouse gas emissions is both an environmental and a business necessity. We committed to a voluntary reduction goal under the EPA Climate Leaders program to demonstrate that we could achieve meaningful carbon reductions. We expanded that goal with Exelon 2020, which will drive our transition to a low-carbon future.\" \"Exelon's leadership on reducing its greenhouse gas emissions shows us all what can be accomplished through sustained commitment and action,\" said Kathleen Hogan, Director, Climate Protection Partnerships Division at the U.S. EPA. Consistent with its cost-efficient approach, Exelon initially focused on its operations to achieve most of its early GHG reductions, including: Retiring less efficient and higher-emitting fossil fuel power plants in Massachusetts, Pennsylvania and Texas Reducing leakage of GHGs, including sulfur hexafluoride, from its electricity transmission and distribution systems and natural gas delivery systems Increasing energy efficiency in its buildings Increasing the fuel efficiency of its vehicle fleet. \"Our progress to date highlights the important role of competitive markets in enabling the transition to a low-carbon economy,\" said Rowe. \"We believe that competitive energy markets are critical in driving economical decisions, such as retiring inefficient fossil plants and pursuing the most cost-effective emissions reductions first. Competition also impels us to advocate for federal cap-and-trade legislation, which we believe will address climate change at the lowest possible cost to customers.\" Exelon continues to implement numerous initiatives this year working toward its Exelon 2020 goal. These include: further increasing the energy efficiency of its buildings, power plants, vehicle fleets; continuing to engage its suppliers to create an industry-leading green supply chain; procuring renewable energy to offset a portion of Exelon's energy consumption; and expanding customer energy-efficiency programs offered by Exelon's energy delivery subsidiaries, ComEd and PECO, including Smart Grid pilot programs. Exelon also plans to continue to increase the output of its nuclear power plants through uprates to offer more low-carbon electricity in the marketplace. Exelon Corporation is one of the nation's largest electric utilities with approximately $19 billion in annual revenues. The company has one of the industry's largest portfolios of electricity generation capacity, with a nationwide reach and strong positions in the Midwest and Mid-Atlantic. Exelon distributes electricity to approximately 5.4 million customers in northern Illinois and southeastern Pennsylvania and natural gas to approximately 485,000 customers in the Philadelphia area. Exelon is headquartered in Chicago and trades on the NYSE under the ticker EXC.

       "      <td>Findlay, Ohio: Marathon Petroleum Corporation has issued the following press release: Virent contributed to an aviation industry first, as United Airlines flew an aircraft full of passengers using 100% sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) in one engine and petroleum-based jet fuel in the other. Virent, a Marathon Petroleum Corp. subsidiary, used its BioFormÂ® process to produce synthesized aromatic kerosene (SAK) â a critical component that made the 100% SAF possible. âVirent â s proprietary technology converts widely available, plant-based sugars into fuels that are 100% renewable and 100% compatible with today â s aviation fleet,â said Virent president and general counsel Dave Kettner. âFor this flight, Virent used corn sugar to manufacture the fuel component that made petroleum blending unnecessary, and so yesterday â s flight demonstrates that we can power sustainable aviation without modifying today â s modern airline engines or the infrastructure that serves the airline industry. â Most SAF â typically made from used cooking oil or vegetable oil â has to be blended with petroleum products because SAF doesn â t have a component called âaromatics,â which is required to meet today â s jet fuel specifications. Virent â s SAK, made from renewable plant sugars, provides those aromatics. Because Virent â s SAK is made from plant-based feedstocks, the carbon impact on a lifecycle basis is less than that of petroleum-based fuels. Virent is targeting greater than 50% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions for SAK from a commercial project, with the potential to achieve net zero emissions using options such as renewable electricity, renewable natural gas and carbon capture and sequestration. Virent has also developed data from engine testing that shows an SAF blend using its SAK is cleaner burning and has lower particulate matter emissions than conventional jet fuels. Passengers on the historic demonstration flight included media, elected officials, and executives from the companies that collaborated on the effort: United Airlines, Boeing, CFM International (a joint venture between GE and Safran Aircraft Engines), Virent, Marathon Petroleum and World Energy â a sustainable aviation fuel manufacturer. âSAF is a relatively new fuel technology, and it â s critical that companies like this group come together to bring SAF into more widespread use,â said Kettner. United Airlines yesterday also announced additional corporate participants in the airline â s Eco-Skies AllianceSM program to collectively contribute toward the purchase of SAF. âPartnering with other companies that are committed to leading in sustainable aviation is an important part of moving SAF forward,â said Ray Brooks, executive vice president of refining for Marathon Petroleum Corporation. âEco Skies Partners are a great example of the kind of demand signals necessary to bring SAF production to industry scale. â Brooks pointed out that air transport will continue to be one of the primary ways people build connections with each other and the world around them, and today â s modern airline industry requires energy-dense liquid fuels. âVirent â s technology is helping to broaden our ability to meet the world â s aviation needs sustainably,â he said. âWe â re proud to join forces with these forward-looking companies that are leading the way in sustainable aviation. This is a great opportunity to meet the needs of today while investing in an energy-diverse future. â Load-Date: December 7, 2021</td>\n",

       "      <td>Chevron, an energy company, issued the following news release: Chevron is going to supply fuel linked to renewable natural gas (RNG) to fuel a portion of Walmart's commercial truck fleet in California. why it matters RNG is a lower carbon alternative to traditional fuels. This agreement represents an opportunity to demonstrate RNG's ability to help reduce emissions in the heavy-duty transportation sector. our perspective We want to help foster a lower carbon future. Decarbonizing the heavy-duty transportation sector will require several different fuel technologies. This agreement will explore the use of RNG as a lower carbon alternative to fueling trucks with traditional fuels. details The trucks using Chevron-supplied fuel will run on the Cummins' X15N, a 15-liter engine that is powered by compressed natural gas (CNG). CNG is generated by storing RNG in high-pressure containers. RNG comes from decomposing organic matter like cow manure and landfill waste, commonly referred to as biomethane. Once the biomethane is captured, treated and placed into the natural gas network, it is considered RNG. Uncaptured methane is 25 times more potent than carbon dioxide and especially good at trapping heat in the atmosphere. Under California's Low Carbon Fuel Standard, capturing methane and converting it into RNG can qualify as a carbon negative fuel on a lifecycle basis. what we're saying \"Chevron has the infrastructure, assets and capabilities to produce and distribute renewable natural gas and other fuels that offer lower carbon options for critical industries in search of solutions,\" said Mike Wirth, Chevron chairman and CEO. what's next Walmart will field-test the RNG-fueled trucks at its distribution center in Fontana, California. If they perform successfully, the engines could be installed in trucks elsewhere in the country. This would be a step toward reducing emissions in the heavy-duty transportation sector.

The plant, expected to begin operations in 2026, will include a 2,080 KTA ethane cracker and two 1,000 KTA high-density polyethylene units. The project is targeting to have approximately 25% lower greenhouse gas emissions than similar facilities in the United States and Europe, supporting the company's efforts to help enable a lower carbon future. Chevron Phillips Chemical will manage engineering, procurement and construction for the project and operate the facility after start-up.  Construction of the Golden Triangle Polymers plant will begin immediately near Chevron Phillips Chemical's existing facility in Orange, located 113 miles east of Houston. Chevron Phillips Chemical and its predecessors have had a presence in the Orange community since 1955.  The engineering, procurement and construction of the polyethylene units will be executed through ZDJV, a joint venture between Zachry Industrial Inc. (Zachry Group) and DL USA, Inc. The furnace portion of the ethane cracker engineering and procurement will be executed by T.EN Stone Weber Process Technology, Inc. while PCL Industrial Construction Co. will provide construction services. Engineering, procurement and construction for the additional portions of the ethane cracker will be executed by JKJV, a joint venture between JGC America, Inc. and Kiewit Energy Group, Inc., and BMZ Third Coast Partners, a joint venture between Burns McDonnell Engineering Company, Inc. and Zachry Industrial, Inc., (Zachry Group) will execute the utilities and infrastructure scope of work. The main automation contractor for the project is Emerson Process Management, LLLP, and W.T. Byler Co., Inc. is managing heavy civil work for the entire site. The project also includes a rail and storage-in-transit yard, with engineering, procurement and construction services provided by W.T. Byler Co., Inc.  'We work hard to be a good neighbor in the communities where we operate, and we are extremely grateful to the community members and public officials in Orange for their support as we developed this project,' Chinn said. 'This facility will contribute to the social and economic fabric of the entire Golden Triangle region of Texas, bringing in thousands of high-paying American jobs and billions of dollars in economic impact. We care deeply about the community of Orange, and we're thrilled to be bringing jobs and resources to the region with safety and environmental performance at the forefront, as always.'

       "12     Chevron Phillips Chemical ('CPChem') announced today plans to expand its polyalphaolefins (PAO) business with the construction of a new unit in Beringen, Belgium.  Once local permits are approved, this significant investment will double the company's PAO production capacity in Belgium (to 120,000MT) upon targeted startup in 2024.  For over 40 years, CPChem has been a leader in the development of high-quality PAOs, which are marketed under the Synfluid brand. PAOs are specially designed chemicals made from alpha olefins. They are used in many synthetic products such as lubricants, greases, and fluids and have emerged as essential components in applications including automotive, industrial, cosmetics, technology, and military use.  'Our Beringen plant has a long history of safe, reliable production of PAOs and of serving our customers with excellence,' said Mitch Eichelberger, executive vice president of polymers and specialties. 'The construction of a new unit near our existing assets will allow us to benefit from strong local expertise and leverage Belgium's central position to meet customer needs globally.'  Synfluid PAOs offer strong advantages due to their unique properties, and they support the company's commitment to accelerating change for a sustainable future. PAOs help reduce energy consumption through efficient lubrication; by reducing friction, they can lower fuel consumption and emissions. The growing demand for PAOs is fueled by the performance of these molecules at extreme temperatures, and also by new applications such as electric and fuel-efficient vehicles and heat transfer fluid.  'Increased production from this new investment will be critical to support growing demand at a time of great innovation in several sectors that require PAOs,' said Antoine Janssens, Europe Africa region general manager.  Ideally located in the heart of Europe, the new PAO unit will enjoy significant advantages in infrastructure, feedstock availability, and operational expertise.

       "13     July 6, 2022  Release date- 05072022 - Chevron Phillips Chemical ('CPChem') announced today plans to expand its polyalphaolefins (PAO) business with the construction of a new unit in Beringen, Belgium. Once local permits are approved, this significant investment will double the company's PAO production capacity in Belgium (to 120,000MT) upon targeted startup in 2024.  For over 40 years, CPChem has been a leader in the development of high-quality PAOs, which are marketed under the Synfluid brand. PAOs are specially designed chemicals made from alpha olefins. They are used in many synthetic products such as lubricants, greases, and fluids and have emerged as essential components in applications including automotive, industrial, cosmetics, technology, and military use.  'Our Beringen plant has a long history of safe, reliable production of PAOs and of serving our customers with excellence,' said Mitch Eichelberger, executive vice president of polymers and specialties. 'The construction of a new unit near our existing assets will allow us to benefit from strong local expertise and leverage Belgium's central position to meet customer needs globally.'  Synfluid PAOs offer strong advantages due to their unique properties, and they support the company's commitment to accelerating change for a sustainable future. PAOs help reduce energy consumption through efficient lubrication; by reducing friction, they can lower fuel consumption and emissions. The growing demand for PAOs is fueled by the performance of these molecules at extreme temperatures, and also by new applications such as electric and fuel-efficient vehicles and heat transfer fluid.  'Increased production from this new investment will be critical to support growing demand at a time of great innovation in several sectors that require PAOs,' said Antoine Janssens, Europe Africa region general manager.  Ideally located in the heart of Europe, the new PAO unit will enjoy significant advantages in infrastructure, feedstock availability, and operational expertise. CPChem already operates PAO units in Beringen, Belgium, and Baytown, Texas. With this new investment, the company is reinforcing its commitment to being the supplier of choice for its growing global customer base.

       "14     March 29, 2022  Release date- 28032022 - Singapore- Chevron Singapore Pte. Ltd., which markets the Caltex retail brand in Singapore, has launched the Caltex Carbon Offset Programme, the first voluntary carbon offset programme for its Caltex service stations in Singapore. Integrated into CaltexGO, Caltex's mobile payment app, customers enrolled in the Caltex loyalty programme can choose to opt-in and use their loyalty points earned from their fuel purchase to offset a portion of the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from the combustion of the fuel purchased when they make payment for their fuel purchases via the CaltexGO app.  Using loyalty points voluntarily contributed by customers enrolled in the Caltex loyalty programme, Caltex and/or its affiliates will purchase verifiable carbon offsets from projects that reduce, remove or avoid portion of GHG emissions from the atmosphere and retire such carbon offsets on a monthly basis, so as to offset a portion of the greenhouse gas emissions from the combustion of relevant fuel purchased.  Brant Fish, President of Chevron International Fuels Lubricants said, 'In 2021, Chevron made progress on more than 35 GHG emission reduction projects, including the first production of renewable diesel, renewable natural gas, and sustainable aviation fuel. These are very good results, which we delivered because of the actions we took over the past few years to strengthen our portfolio, and make Chevron an even more disciplined, efficient, and lower-carbon energy company. In 2022, we are proud to expand on Chevron's lower carbon options for consumers with the launch of the first Caltex Carbon Offset Programme in Singapore. We are driving energy progress essential to a growing, dynamic world while listening to customer feedback.'  When customers fuel up at Caltex service stations and pay via the CaltexGO app, a fuel purchase of 50 litres will generate 100 loyalty points.

These carbon offsets are verified by an independent third-party, the Verified Carbon Standard Program.  For the launch, Chevron Singapore has chosen to purchase carbon offsets from identified nature-based projects from the Verra registry. More details of the projects can be found in Annex A.

       "892    Findlay, Ohio: Marathon Petroleum Corporation has issued the following press release: Virent contributed to an aviation industry first, as United Airlines flew an aircraft full of passengers using 100% sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) in one engine and petroleum-based jet fuel in the other. Virent, a Marathon Petroleum Corp. subsidiary, used its BioFormÂ® process to produce synthesized aromatic kerosene (SAK) â a critical component that made the 100% SAF possible. âVirent â s proprietary technology converts widely available, plant-based sugars into fuels that are 100% renewable and 100% compatible with today â s aviation fleet,â said Virent president and general counsel Dave Kettner. âFor this flight, Virent used corn sugar to manufacture the fuel component that made petroleum blending unnecessary, and so yesterday â s flight demonstrates that we can power sustainable aviation without modifying today â s modern airline engines or the infrastructure that serves the airline industry. â Most SAF â typically made from used cooking oil or vegetable oil â has to be blended with petroleum products because SAF doesn â t have a component called âaromatics,â which is required to meet today â s jet fuel specifications. Virent â s SAK, made from renewable plant sugars, provides those aromatics. Because Virent â s SAK is made from plant-based feedstocks, the carbon impact on a lifecycle basis is less than that of petroleum-based fuels. Virent is targeting greater than 50% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions for SAK from a commercial project, with the potential to achieve net zero emissions using options such as renewable electricity, renewable natural gas and carbon capture and sequestration. Virent has also developed data from engine testing that shows an SAF blend using its SAK is cleaner burning and has lower particulate matter emissions than conventional jet fuels. Passengers on the historic demonstration flight included media, elected officials, and executives from the companies that collaborated on the effort: United Airlines, Boeing, CFM International (a joint venture between GE and Safran Aircraft Engines), Virent, Marathon Petroleum and World Energy â a sustainable aviation fuel manufacturer. âSAF is a relatively new fuel technology, and it â s critical that companies like this group come together to bring SAF into more widespread use,â said Kettner. United Airlines yesterday also announced additional corporate participants in the airline â s Eco-Skies AllianceSM program to collectively contribute toward the purchase of SAF. âPartnering with other companies that are committed to leading in sustainable aviation is an important part of moving SAF forward,â said Ray Brooks, executive vice president of refining for Marathon Petroleum Corporation. âEco Skies Partners are a great example of the kind of demand signals necessary to bring SAF production to industry scale. â Brooks pointed out that air transport will continue to be one of the primary ways people build connections with each other and the world around them, and today â s modern airline industry requires energy-dense liquid fuels. âVirent â s technology is helping to broaden our ability to meet the world â s aviation needs sustainably,â he said. âWe â re proud to join forces with these forward-looking companies that are leading the way in sustainable aviation. This is a great opportunity to meet the needs of today while investing in an energy-diverse future. â Load-Date: December 7, 2021                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",
       "894    Chevron, an energy company, issued the following news release: Chevron is going to supply fuel linked to renewable natural gas (RNG) to fuel a portion of Walmart's commercial truck fleet in California. why it matters RNG is a lower carbon alternative to traditional fuels. This agreement represents an opportunity to demonstrate RNG's ability to help reduce emissions in the heavy-duty transportation sector. our perspective We want to help foster a lower carbon future. Decarbonizing the heavy-duty transportation sector will require several different fuel technologies. This agreement will explore the use of RNG as a lower carbon alternative to fueling trucks with traditional fuels. details The trucks using Chevron-supplied fuel will run on the Cummins' X15N, a 15-liter engine that is powered by compressed natural gas (CNG). CNG is generated by storing RNG in high-pressure containers. RNG comes from decomposing organic matter like cow manure and landfill waste, commonly referred to as biomethane. Once the biomethane is captured, treated and placed into the natural gas network, it is considered RNG. Uncaptured methane is 25 times more potent than carbon dioxide and especially good at trapping heat in the atmosphere. Under California's Low Carbon Fuel Standard, capturing methane and converting it into RNG can qualify as a carbon negative fuel on a lifecycle basis. what we're saying \"Chevron has the infrastructure, assets and capabilities to produce and distribute renewable natural gas and other fuels that offer lower carbon options for critical industries in search of solutions,\" said Mike Wirth, Chevron chairman and CEO. what's next Walmart will field-test the RNG-fueled trucks at its distribution center in Fontana, California. If they perform successfully, the engines could be installed in trucks elsewhere in the country. This would be a step toward reducing emissions in the heavy-duty transportation sector.
